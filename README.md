# ShaderSphereExplode-Feb21
openframeworks geometry shader tests - explode objects

This is an attempt to disintegrate objects over time. Eventually it should be able to recieve an 'age'
and move the triangles down the screen with a trajectory specific to each item.

This will be part of the visualization of my multiple kinect project completed for my Masters in CMD.
